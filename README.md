# :earth_africa: Final-Project - "OIKO - interactive stories about biomes and ecosystems for Young Learners"

### The final project of our DCI course in Fullstack Web Development is aimed at putting our skills to test. We wanted to have fun creating something exciting and engaging, and possibly learn even more on the way.

We created this website to offer you a fun experience while exploring different ecosystems/biomes and learning about their uniqueness and relevance in a playful way. We hope you enjoy discovering some interesting facts about our planetâ€™s astonishing landscapes :ocean:, amazing wildlife :monkey:, and diverse flora :cactus:.

At the end of each exploration you can do a fun little quiz to test your knowledge and collect some badges on your profile :trophy:!
