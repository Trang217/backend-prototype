      "Definition",
      "The word 'desert' means 'abandoned place', which is spot on for these places that have harsh conditions. Deserts are dry regions of terrain with limited rainfall. In the desert, temperatures can soar as high as 120 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius) in some areas; but because there is no cloud cover to keep warmth in, deserts can also get very cold at night, with temperatures plunging as low as –4 degrees Fahrenheit (–20 degrees Celsius) in places. Deserts can also be very windy, which can stir up violent sandstorms."

      "Landform",
      "Deserts contain many different natural features, which are called landforms. These include mountains and rock formations, such as strangely shaped hills and big rocks. Valleys, which are low-lying areas between mountains or hills, and canyons, which are narrow valleys with very steep sides, are also landforms found in many deserts. Flat regions called plains, sand dunes, and oases are other desert landscape features. Landforms are formed over thousands of years by the actions of windblown sand, water, and the heat of the sun on the landscape."

      "Camel",
      "A camel is a large animal with a long neck and one or two humps on its back. Camels store most of their fat in the hump. When there is a shortage of food and water, the camels convert the fat stored in the hump into energy. This adaptation helps camels to survive for up to six months without a meal. The camel is well known as the ship of the desert because it can travel long distances on the desert sand without food or water, carrying heavy loads of above 200 kg. They have been used and are still being used for transport across the desert."

      "Tortoise",
      "The desert tortoise is able to adapt to the extreme temperature of the desert through its large urinary bladder. Whenever it finds water, it works like a sponge, storing enough water to equal over 40 percent of its body weight. Because of this amazing ability, it can go without water for months. Adults are known to go without water for nearly one year. Major food sources include fruits, herbs and wildflowers."

      "Fennec Fox",
      "Meet the fennec fox: While it is the smallest fox in the world, the fennec fox possesses tons of cuteness and charm. With their most notable characteristic being their large ears, they are always a favorite. These pint-sized canids are extremely adaptable in their native desert environment."

    "item_5": [
      "Ostrich",
      "The ostrich is the largest and heaviest living bird. As its species name, camelus, suggests, the ostrich was once known as the “camel bird” because of its long neck, prominent eyes, and sweeping eyelashes, as well as its jolting walk. Also, like camels, the ostrich can tolerate high temperatures and go without water for long periods of time."

    "item_6": [
      "Ringtail",
      "Drat, I'm not a cat!  Even though this eye-catching omnivore sports a few vaguely feline characteristics such as pointy ears, a sleek body, and a fluffy tail, the ringtail is really a member of the raccoon family.Its cat-like appearance and famed mouse-hunting skills have earned it several common names, including ring-tail cat, civet cat, and miner’s cat (it reportedly kept gold miners’ quarters vermin-free)."
    ],
    "item_7": [
      "Rattlesnake",
      "Beautiful and misunderstood: Rattlesnakes! Rattlesnakes are known for their relatively heavy bodies and diamond-shaped heads. They are considered to be the newest or most recently evolved snakes in the world. Rattlesnakes have either a rattle or a partial rattle made of interlocking rings, or segments of keratin, the same material our fingernails are made of. When vibrated, the rattle creates a hissing sound that warns off potential predators. It is an extremely effective and highly evolved predator-avoidance system. "

    "item_8": [
      "Elephant tree",
      "The elephant tree has a short, stubby trunk and branches that look like an elephant's legs. It only grows to be about 10 feet tall and has white, flaky bark. The branches have many small, reddish twigs growing from them. From the twigs grow dull, light green leaves and creamy, white flowers. With a lifespan of up to 80 years, it makes sense that elephants really do have great memories."

      "Desert sage",
      "Desert Sage is a shrub. It grows about 2-3 meters in height. The flowers of this shrub are deep blue in color with purple bracts. This shrub is an evergreen plant. It does not require water once it has set well."
    ],
    "item_10": [
      "Cactus",
      "The cactus is a type of plant called a succulent. This means that it can store water in its stems, roots, and leaves. There are about 2000 types of cacti, and they come in different shapes, sizes, and colors. Green may be the most common color for cacti, but it can also be bluish or brown-green. Some cactus plants are very round, and others are flat like a pancake. Some are even shaped like snakes or starfish. A cactus plant can be very small or very big. The largest type of cacti can grow to be 66 feet tall and weigh up to 4800 pounds. That’s as heavy as a car!"

      "Boojum Tree",
      "This is the boojum: a tree-like succulent with a water-storing trunk and an array of spiny branches with tiny leaves. Boojums grow best in very dry climates where they have plenty of room to spread their spiny branches. It can take 50 to 100 years for a boojum to mature and flower."

    "item_12": [
      "Yucca",
      "Yuccas grow in deserts, prairies, dry woodlands, and scrub in North America, as far north as Alberta, Canada and as far south as Guatemala. They are particularly common in landscapes of the American Southwest and Mexico. Yuccas make striking ornamental landscaping plants for sunny locations, particularly in regions that are hot and dry. They are drought-tolerant, and many species and cultivars are available in nurseries."
