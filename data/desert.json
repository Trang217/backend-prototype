      "Where am I?",
      "Deserts are dry regions of terrain with limited rainfall./In the desert, temperatures can soar as high as 50 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) in some areas, but because there is no cloud cover to keep warmth in, hot deserts can also get very cold at night, with temperatures plunging as low as –20 degrees Celsius (–4 degrees Fahrenheit) in places. Deserts can also be very windy, which can stir up violent sandstorms./Cold deserts are still dry but have extremely low temperatures in comparison to the other types of deserts. The Antarctic is an example of a cold desert."

    "item_1": [
      "Desert? You mean something sweet like ice cream?",
      "The word 'desert' means 'abandoned place', which is spot on for these places that have very harsh conditions. Some deserts are among the planet's last remaining areas of total wilderness. Yet more than one billion people, one-sixth of Earth's population, actually live in desert regions. That makes sense since deserts take up to 33% or one third of the land's surface area."

      "The landscape is so pretty!",
      "Deserts contain many different natural features, which are called landforms. These include mountains and rock formations, such as strangely shaped hills and big rocks./Valleys, which are low-lying areas between mountains or hills, and canyons, which are even narrower valleys with very steep sides, are also landforms found in many deserts./Flat regions called plains, sand dunes, and oases are other desert landscape features. Landforms are formed over thousands of years by the actions of windblown sand, water, and the heat of the sun on the landscape."

      "Hmm, I would like to know a few deserts!",
      "You can find deserts on all continents, except for Europe. The largest hot desert Sahara is located in Africa and spans over 12 countries! Other deserts in Africa are for example Kalahari and Namib./In the Americas you will find for example Colorado and Chihuahuan deserts in the north, and Patagonian and Atacama deserts in the south./Cold Gobi desert and hot Arabian desert are the largest ones in Asia./Australia has Gibson and Great Victoria deserts./A whole continent of Antarctica is a desert!"

      "Hello, little friend!",
      "Meet the fennec fox: While it is the smallest fox in the world, the fennec fox possesses tons of cuteness and charm.With their most notable characteristic being their large ears, they are always a favorite./These pint-sized canidae, which means 'dogs', are extremely adaptable in their native desert environment."

    "item_5": [
      "Oh, this bird is so large!",
      "The common ostrich is the largest and heaviest living bird. As its species name, 'Struthio camelus', suggests, the ostrich was once known as the “camel bird” because of its long neck, prominent eyes, and sweeping eyelashes, as well as its jolting walk./Also, like camels, the ostrich can tolerate high temperatures and go without water for long periods of time."

    "item_6": [
      "Hey, is that a cat?",
      "Drat, I'm not a cat! Even though this eye-catching omnivore (which means it eats both plants and animals) sports a few vaguely feline characteristics such as pointy ears, a sleek body, and a fluffy tail, the ringtail is really a member of the raccoon family./Its cat-like appearance and famed mouse-hunting skills have earned it several common names, including ring-tail cat, civet cat, and miner’s cat (it reportedly kept gold miners’ quarters vermin-free)."
    ],
    "item_7": [
      "Ouch, it has spikes!",
      "The cactus is a type of plant called a succulent. This means that it can store water in its stems, roots, and leaves. There are about 2000 types of cacti, and they come in different shapes, sizes, and colors./Green may be the most common color for cacti, but it can also be bluish or brown-green. Some cactus plants are very round, and others are flat like a pancake. Some are even shaped like snakes or starfish./A cactus plant can be very small or very big. The largest type of cacti can grow to be 20 meters (66 feet) tall and weigh up to 2100 kilograms (4800 pounds). That’s as heavy as a car!"

    "item_8": [
      "Oh, it's so green here!",
      "At times you’ll find water in the desert. This water source is an oasis and is usually surrounded by greenery./To keep the desert sands away from sensitive crops and water, people plant sturdy trees. They plant trees like palms along the edge of the oasis."
    ],
    "item_9": [
      "Another plant!",
      "Desert Sage is a shrub. It grows about 2-3 meters (6-9 feet) in height. The flowers of this shrub are deep blue in color with purple bracts./This shrub is an evergreen plant. It does not require water once it has set well."

    "item_10": [
      "Is it dangerous?",
      "Beautiful and misunderstood, rattlesnakes are known for their relatively heavy bodies and diamond-shaped heads. They are considered to be the newest or most recently evolved snakes in the world./Rattlesnakes have either a rattle or a partial rattle made of interlocking rings, or segments of keratin, the same material our fingernails are made of. When vibrated, the rattle creates a hissing sound that warns off potential predators. It is an extremely effective and highly evolved predator-avoidance system. "

    "item_11": [
      "What kind of plant is this?",
      "This is the boojum - a tree-like succulent with a water-storing trunk and an array of spiny branches with tiny leaves./Boojums grow best in very dry climates where they have plenty of room to spread their branches. It can take 50 to 100 years for a boojum to mature and flower. That's a looong time!"

    "item_12": [
      "Oh, it has pretty flowers!",
      "Yuccas grow in deserts, prairies, dry woodlands, and scrub in North America, as far north as Alberta, Canada and as far south as Guatemala. They are particularly common in landscapes of the American Southwest and Mexico./Yuccas make striking ornamental landscaping plants for sunny locations, particularly in regions that are hot and dry. They are drought-tolerant, and many species and cultivars are available in nurseries."

      "Look at this strange animal with a hump!",
      "It's a camel. It is a large animal with a long neck and one or two humps on its back. Camels store most of their fat in the hump. When there is a shortage of food and water, the camels convert the fat stored in the hump into energy./This adaptation helps camels to survive for up to six months without a meal. The camel is well known as the 'ship of the desert' because it can travel long distances on the desert sand without food or water, carrying heavy loads of above 200 kg. They have been and are still being used for transport across many deserts."

    "item_14": [
      "It looks like an elephant!",
      "The elephant tree has a short, stubby trunk and branches that look like an elephant's legs. It can store a lot of water in its sculptural trunk. In their native environment, some species of this family can grow to about 9 meters (30 feet) tall, but they are also popular as small houseplants - grown as bonsai, which is a miniature tree in a pot./The branches have many small, reddish twigs growing from them. From the twigs grow dull, light green leaves and creamy, white flowers."

    "item_15": [
      "What's that moving stone?",
      "The desert tortoise is able to adapt to the extreme temperature of the desert through its large urinary bladder. Whenever it finds water, it works like a sponge, storing enough water to equal over 40 percent of its body weight./Because of this amazing ability, it can go without water for months. Adult tortoises are known to go without water for nearly one year. They eat fruits, herbs and wildflowers."
